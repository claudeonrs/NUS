How to SSH with Mac OSX?

You may need to VPN in to use the Unix server, if you are unable to connect to it directly.
For a guide on how to VPN, see: 
https://dochub.comp.nus.edu.sg/cf/guides/network/vpn (requires SOC login) or
https://nusit.nus.edu.sg/eguides/

Ok, let's get started:
1. Run terminal (search in spotlight for 'Terminal' or select 'Terminal' from the applications>utilities folder)
2. Type <ssh userid@stu.comp.nus.edu.sg> (Note that this userid is your SOC account and password)
3. Enter your password.
4. You're in!


If you're prompted about a RSA key, just type yes.


How to transfer files between Mac and the server?
1. Use cyberduck

2. Alternatively, you can use the command line to transfer files 
   to and from the server. 

   Use the scp command from your local Mac terminal. 
   (NOTE: This is to be done without SSHing into the server)
   The scp commands works like the cp command.

   The format is:
            scp <source-path> <destination-path>

   Use  -r flag after scp in case you are transferring an entire directory.

   Example Usage:
   For transferring a directory lab1 in your Downloads 
   directory to your home directory on the server,
            scp -r ~/Downloads/lab1 axxxxxx@stu.comp.nus.edu.sg:~/

   Replace axxxxxxx with your username in the server.

   To transfer the file back to your computer, simply invert the source and destination

            scp -r axxxxxx@stu.comp.nus.edu.sg:~/lab1 ~/Downloads/
