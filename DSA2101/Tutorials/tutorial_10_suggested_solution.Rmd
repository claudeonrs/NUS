In this tutorial, we continue with the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset from 
Tutorial 8. The following plot is created using the GGally package. It 
shows scatterplots of all combinations of continuous variables in the dataset.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='100%'}
library(tidyverse)
library(GGally)
wdbc <- read.csv("../data/wdbc.data", sep = ",", header=FALSE) %>% 
  select(1:12) %>% as_tibble()
colnames(wdbc) <- c("ID", "diagnosis", "radius", "texture", "perimeter", 
                      "area", "smoothness", "compactness", "concavity", 
                      "concave_points", "symmetry", "fractal_dimension") 

knitr::include_graphics("../figs/t10_2210.png")

select(wdbc, -1) %>%  
  ggpairs(mapping=aes(color=diagnosis),#columns = 2:4,
        lower=list(continuous=wrap("points", alpha=0.5),
                   combo="box_no_facet"),
        upper=list(combo="facethist"),
        diag=list(continuous=wrap("densityDiag", alpha=0.5)))
```

Take some time to study the plots. Remember that, for this dataset, we are 
interested in which variables would aid in predicting the diagnosis variable.

What observations can you make? Here are some ideas to help us decide what to do next:

1. radius, perimeter, and area are very highly correlated with one another. We 
   can probably do with just one of them.
2. On their own, symmetry and fractal dimension will probably not allow us to 
   discriminate between diagnoses.
3. The points in some of the scatter plots can be neatly divided with a horizontal 
   or vertical line, e.g. compactness-concavity, and texture-area. In some others,
   the dividing line is a diagonal line, e.g. texture-compactness. This suggests 
   that maybe some combination of 3 or more numerical variables can allow us to 
   classify a tumour better.

Pick at least two continuous variables along with `diagnosis`, and create a chart of 
your own.

Here is one possible chart, similar to one in our lecture notes. It is similar to a
coloured scatter plot, but reflects proportion of malignant cases in each bin.

```{r fig.align='center', out.width='70%'}
mutate(wdbc, diagnosis=recode(diagnosis, "M"= 1, "B"=0)) %>%  
  ggplot(wdbc, mapping= aes(x=radius, y=concavity, z=diagnosis)) +  
  stat_summary_hex(fun= mean, binwidth = c(2, 0.05))
```

Here is one more. This is a heat-map or pivot table.

```{r fig.align='center', out.width='70%'}
cat_levels <- mutate(wdbc, 
                     rad_levels = cut_number(radius, 4),
                     concav_levels= cut_number(concavity, n=4))

group_by(cat_levels, rad_levels, concav_levels) %>% 
  summarise(prop_mal = mean(diagnosis == "M"), 
            n=n(), .groups="drop") %>% 
ggplot() + 
  geom_tile(aes(x=rad_levels, y=concav_levels, fill = prop_mal)) + 
  geom_text(aes(x=rad_levels, y=concav_levels, 
                label=paste0(sprintf("%.3f", prop_mal), "\n Count:", n)))

```

In fact, it is similar to a chart we created in a previous tutorial using lines.
Once we have the binned data, we can create it:
```{r}
group_by(cat_levels, rad_levels, concav_levels) %>% 
  summarise(prop_mal = mean(diagnosis == "M"), 
            n=n(), .groups="drop") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=rad_levels, y=prop_mal, col=concav_levels)) + 
  geom_line(aes(group=concav_levels)) + 
  geom_point() + #scale_color_brewer(palette="Greens")
  labs(title="Proportion of Malignant cases, by concavity level")
```

With binning, we can also add a third numeric variable in this way:
```{r}
ggplot(cat_levels, aes(col=diagnosis)) + 
  geom_point(aes(x=compactness, y=fractal_dimension)) + 
  facet_wrap(~rad_levels, nrow=2)

#ggplot(cat_levels, aes(col=diagnosis)) + 
#  geom_density_2d(aes(x=compactness, y=fractal_dimension)) + 
#  facet_wrap(~rad_levels, nrow=2)
```
In a plot such as this, we would be checking if the separation of points by
colour improves as compared to not faceting.

If you prefer to keep all 3 variables unbinned, one option to visualise them is to use 
an interactive 3D plot. Here is one way we can create such an interactive plot:
```{r}
library(plotly)

fig <- plot_ly(wdbc, 
               x = ~radius, y = ~symmetry, 
               z = ~concavity, color = ~diagnosis, 
               colors = c('#BF382A', '#0C4B8E'))

fig <- fig %>% add_markers()
fig <- fig %>% layout(scene = list(xaxis = list(title = 'radius'),
                     yaxis = list(title = 'symmetry'),
                     zaxis = list(title = 'concavity')))
fig
```

*plotly will not be covered in our exam*.


## Question 2

Create a parallel coordinates plot of the dataset, just like in the lecture notes
(topic 05). How can you improve it to flesh out the relationship between the 
variables and `diagnosis`?

```{r}
ggparcoord(wdbc,3:12, groupColumn = "diagnosis")
```

The chart above has a couple of deficiencies:

* Overplotting makes it look cluttered.
  * let us try a little transparency to fix this
* It is not easy to tell if each group has a "profile" across all the variables.
  * let us try to order the variables to help with this, and then provide a reference 
    line for each variable.

This code chunk orders the variables by difference in median for the two groups. 
```{r}
select(wdbc, 3:12) %>% 
  scale() -> scaled_vars

scaled_wdbc <- bind_cols(diagnosis= wdbc$diagnosis, as.data.frame(scaled_vars)) %>% 
  as_tibble()

scaled_wdbc %>% group_by(diagnosis) %>% 
  summarise(across(radius:fractal_dimension, .fns=median)) -> tmp_groups
abs(tmp_groups[1,-1] - tmp_groups[2, -1]) %>% as.vector() %>% unlist() %>% 
  sort(decreasing = TRUE) -> ordered_vars

ordered_scaled_wdbc <- bind_cols(scaled_wdbc[,1], scaled_wdbc[, names(ordered_vars)])

bind_cols(wdbc[,2], wdbc[,names(ordered_vars)]) %>%  
  ggparcoord(columns = 2:11, groupColumn = 1, alphaLines = 0.1) -> p1

scaled_wdbc %>% mutate(id = row_number(), .before=diagnosis) %>% 
  pivot_longer(radius:fractal_dimension, names_to = "variable", values_to="value") %>% 
  group_by(diagnosis, variable) %>% 
  summarise(qtles = quantile(value, probs=c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75)), .groups="drop") %>% 
  mutate(qtl_level  = rep(c("lower", "med", "upper"), 20)) %>%
  pivot_wider(id_cols = 1:2, values_from = qtles, names_from="qtl_level") -> df2
```

This first attempt uses a line geom to show the interquartile range within each 
group.

```{r fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
p1  + geom_line(data=df2, aes(x=variable, y=lower, col=diagnosis, group=diagnosis), 
                inherit.aes = FALSE, lwd=1.2, lty=3) +  
  geom_line(data=df2, aes(x=variable, y=upper, col=diagnosis, group=diagnosis),  
            inherit.aes = FALSE,
            lwd=1.2, lty=3) +  
  geom_line(data=df2, aes(x=variable, y=med, col=diagnosis, group=diagnosis),  
            inherit.aes=FALSE,
            lwd=1.5, lty=2)  

```

The second attempt uses vertical lines because the previous one seems overshadowed 
by the lines in the background, despite the transparency.

```{r fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
p1 + geom_point(data=df2, mapping=aes(x=variable, y=med, col=diagnosis), 
                inherit.aes = FALSE) +
  geom_errorbar(data=df2, aes(x=variable, ymin=lower, ymax=upper,
                              col=diagnosis), width=0.1, inherit.aes=FALSE)
```

If we are just interested in the univariate distributions, we could just use a boxplot:

```{r}
scaled_wdbc %>% mutate(id = row_number(), .before=diagnosis) %>% 
  pivot_longer(radius:fractal_dimension, names_to = "variable", values_to="value") %>% 
  ggplot() + 
  geom_boxplot(aes(x=variable, y=value, fill=diagnosis), outlier.alpha = 0.7) +
  xlim(names(ordered_vars))
```

We could even show lines and boxplot together:
```{r}
scaled_wdbc %>% mutate(id = row_number(), .before=diagnosis) %>% 
  pivot_longer(radius:fractal_dimension, names_to = "variable", values_to="value") %>% 
  ggplot() + 
  geom_line(aes(x=variable, y=value, group=id, col=diagnosis), alpha=0.1)+
  geom_boxplot(aes(x=variable, y=value, fill=diagnosis), outlier.alpha = 0.7) +
  xlim(names(ordered_vars))
```
