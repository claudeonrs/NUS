Human Development Index is a measure of average achievement in three key dimensions of
human development: length of life, education level and standard of living. The HDI is the geometric mean
of normalised indices for each of these three dimensions. HDI values are between 
0 and 1; a value closer to 1 indicates that an individual from that country has 
more opportunities to develop to his or her full potential.

The health dimension is assessed by life expectancy at birth. The education
dimension is measured by mean years of schooling for adults aged 25 years and
more, and expected years of schooling for children. The standard of living is
measured by national income per capita. The scores for the three dimensions are
then aggregated into a composite index using the geometric mean.

The data in `Human Development Index (HDI).xlsx` contains the HDI ratings for
189 countries from 1990 until 2017. Some values are missing.

# Question 1 (10 marks)

Here is a visualisation of HDI, taken from the internet.

```{r out.width="75%", fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
include_graphics("../figs/final_1920_img1.jpg")
```

In the text box below, comment on the visualisation. Remember to address the 
following points:

1. What's good and what's bad about this graphic?
2. What do you understand/conclude from this graphic?
3. What alternative geoms could have been used?
4. What questions/visualisations would you follow up with?

## Suggested Solution 

This looks like a pie-chart, with wedges of different sizes. There is essentially
only one variable: the number of people in the world falling into a particular 
level of human-development. The rest is chart-junk: the colours are not from a 
sequential palette. It is not clear if it is the arc-length of the wedge or the 
radius of the wedge that corresponds to the HDI category. It is also unclear 
if the HDI values (0.504, 0.643, etc.) correspond to the average HDI within 
each category, or if these are the values used to decide which category level 
a country falls into.

My understanding is that 12\% of the world's population does not have the right 
opportunities to develop.

A simple bar-chart would have sufficed. I would also be interested to know how 
many countries fall into each category in addition to the number of people in 
each category. A comparison with another year would give me a better context 
to the 2017 situation.

# Question 2 (10 marks)

Re-create the following plot, which depicts how HDI has changed from 1990 until
2017 for two countries in South-East Asia.

```{r out.width="50%", fig.align="center", fig.width=4, fig.height=2}
hdi <- read_excel("../data/Human Development Index (HDI).xlsx", na="..")

mysin <- filter(hdi, Country %in% c("Singapore", "Malaysia")) %>% 
  select(2,3,30) %>% 
  gather(2:3, key=year, value=hdi)

ggplot(mysin) + 
  geom_tile(aes(x=year, y=Country, fill=hdi), col="white", show.legend=FALSE) +
  geom_text(aes(x=year, y=Country, label = hdi), col="white", size=6) + 
  theme(axis.text = element_text(size=17, face="bold"), 
        axis.ticks = element_blank())+
  labs(title="", x="", y="")
```

# Question 3 (10 marks)

Write a function `get_highest_rank` that will compute and print the highest
yearly rank that a country has reached, and when it first achieved that rank.
For instance, here is the output for Colombia. *Just to clarify, rank number 1
is the best - it corresponds to the country with the highest HDI for that year.*

```{r echo=FALSE}
hdi_tidy <- select(hdi, -1) %>% gather(-1, key=year, value=hdi)

get_highest_rank <- function(country, data) {
  rank_added <- group_by(data, year) %>% 
    mutate(rank = min_rank(desc(hdi)))
  
  top_rank <- group_by(rank_added, Country, add=FALSE) %>% 
    arrange(rank, year, .by_group = TRUE) %>% 
    filter(row_number() == 1, Country == country)

  cat(paste0("The highest rank achieved by ", country, " was ", 
             top_rank$rank, "."), "\n")
  cat(paste0("This was first achieved in ", top_rank$year, "."), "\n")
}
```

```{r}
get_highest_rank("Colombia", hdi_tidy)
```

# Question 4 (20 marks)

Suppose we wish to invesigate the change in HDI over the years. Create **two
plots** that visualise this data, and summarize your findings/investigations in
words. There is an additional dataset (`country_conti.csv`) that groups the
countries into broad geographical regions, in case you wish to use it.

Remember that you will graded on your ability to follow up on an initial 
hypothesis, so the two plots should ideally be related, with the second one 
uncovering or explaining more about the data than the first.

## Some Possible Plots

This is the most direct one to make; in general the HDI is going up.

```{r fig.align='center', out.width='70%'}
regions <- read.csv("../data/country_conti.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
hdi_tidy <- left_join(hdi_tidy, regions, by="Country") %>% 
  mutate(year = as.numeric(year))

filter(hdi_tidy, !is.na(hdi)) %>%  
  ggplot() +  
  geom_line(aes(x=year, y=hdi, group=Country), alpha=0.2) + 
  labs(title="Human Development Over the Years", x="Year", y="HDI")
```

Now if we facet by region, we see that a judicious arrangement of regions 
allows to see how poor the African nations are doing.

```{r out.width="70%", fig.align='center'}
hdi2 <- mutate(hdi_tidy, 
       Continent = case_when(
         str_detect(Region, "Asia") ~ "Asia",
         Region == "Oceania" ~ "Oceania",
         str_detect(Region, "Europe") ~ "Europe",
         str_detect(Region, "Africa") ~ "Africa",
         TRUE ~ "Americas"
       )) %>%
  mutate(Region = factor(Region, levels=c("Western Asia", "Central Asia", 
                                          "South-Eastern Asia", "Southern Asia", 
                                          "Eastern Asia", 
                                          "Western Africa", "Middle Africa", 
                                          "Southern Africa", "Northern Africa", 
                                          "Eastern Africa",
                                          "South America", "Central America", 
                                          "North America", "Caribbean", 
                                          "Oceania", "Western Europe", "Eastern Europe")))

filter(hdi2, !is.na(hdi)) %>%  
  ggplot() +  
  geom_line(aes(x=year, y=hdi, group=Country, col=Continent), 
            show.legend = FALSE, alpha=0.6) + 
  facet_wrap(~Region, ncol=5) + 
  labs(title="HDI over time, by region and continent")
```

Next, we follow the categorization from question 1, to see how the distribution 
of categories has changed over the 27 years.

```{r out.width="70%", fig.align='center'}
hdi2 <- mutate(hdi2, hdi_cat = case_when(
                 hdi <= 0.504 ~ "Low",
                 hdi <= 0.645 ~ "Medium",
                 hdi <= 0.757 ~ "High",
                 TRUE ~ "Very High")) %>%
  mutate(hdi_cat = factor(hdi_cat, levels=c("Low", "Medium", "High", "Very High")))

tmp <- filter(hdi2, year %in% c(2007, 2017)) %>%
  count(year, Region, hdi_cat) %>% 
  spread(key=hdi_cat, value=n, fill=0) %>% 
  gather(Low:`Very High`, key=hdi_cat, value=n) %>% 
  mutate(hdi_cat = factor(hdi_cat, levels=c("Low", "Medium", "High", "Very High")))
ggplot(tmp) +
  geom_col(aes(x=hdi_cat, y=n, fill=as.factor(year)), position="dodge") +
  facet_wrap( ~ Region, ncol=5) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom", axis.text.x=element_text(size=5)) + 
  labs(title="Change in HDI Category Distribution in 10 years", y="Country count",
       x="Category") +
  scale_fill_discrete(name="Year")
```

A final plot to see how countries in the low category in 1990 are doing now.

```{r out.width="85%", fig.align='center'}
low_1990 <- filter(hdi2, year == 1990, hdi_cat == "Low") %>%
  select(Country)
low_now <- left_join(low_1990, hdi2, by="Country") %>%
  filter(year %in% c(1990, 2017))

ggplot(low_now, aes(x=year, y=hdi)) +
  geom_point(alpha=0.4) + 
  geom_line(aes(group=Country), alpha=0.4) + facet_wrap(~Continent) + 
  expand_limits(x=c(1985,2020)) + 
  geom_hline(yintercept=c(0.00, 0.504, 0.645, 0.757), lty=3, col='red') + 
  theme_minimal() + 
  labs(x="Year", y="HDI", title="Where are they now?") + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(1990, 2017))
```
